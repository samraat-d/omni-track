## Logic
- Google Calendar: 
Add events, edit events, delete events
Add timetable as an event
upload image → feed it to any ocr → format output → add events in loop
Loop through each event

- Result Calculator:
CGPA, SGPA: take input of semester
Graph - display cgpa vs semester (progress): table stores the marks and semester → retrieve it and display graph
Schema diagram for the table and query to get cgpa

- Finance features details:

- GIST - graphing expenses, keeping track of remaining based on daily expenditure, savings, track of money that gets spent monthly -fixed (fees, transport, food, subscriptions), variable (entertainment)

- Account details
ID, Name, Age, DOB, Gender, Email, Phone Number, Username, Password
Optional: OTP to verify phone number, recaptcha verification
